#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Attack movement, Enemy, Health, UI,changing level

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Dunno where to get the correct data I want, or finding the correct assets for my game. I have to follow the tutorial for the game I am creating. but will add further afteer finishing the tutorial. Such as more new enemies, a different map and that will be it for my final project. I find even with the blueprint you still need to follow logic steps just like coding in python such as a event starter to actually excute the code.
