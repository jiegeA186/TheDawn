# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

“Mushroom Land”

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A 2D RPG using UE5。(Due to Technical issue has to follow a blueprint but deciding to add further to the project)

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The Project that I propose will be using Unity Engine 5 to create a small 2D game that mostly about managing resources and building a base enough to defense and survive until morning. The longer the game period the harder the opponents are.To win you will need to reach specific objectives.
The function of the Game might include:
 - Health Bar 
 - Basic Movement of Sprinting and walking, attack
 - Simple AI(Enemy, Allies)
 - A menu of Start, Pause,  etc
 - ETC

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

 - One good outcome no matter what is creating a Game!

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

 - I will know how to implement functions to my software(Game) and see how it actually works if applying the ideas that I learn from the course

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

 - Know how to use Engine to create any other things beside games
 - Gain more ways to look at problems

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

 - I need to watch videos in order to learn how to use UE5. I need to see how they apply data files that increase the appearance of the overall game, applying different types of file to help implement special types of function. Also, learning how to debug the game when coming to an error and moddifying the game to make the flow more fluent in movement and attack.
